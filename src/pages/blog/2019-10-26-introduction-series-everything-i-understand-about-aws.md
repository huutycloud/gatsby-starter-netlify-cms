In this series, I will mainly learn about AWS services. An article is expected to be written daily about an AWS computing service. I will write in English for improve my writing skill. Hope you will follow your posts regularly.

The knowledge I gathered from the Udemy courses and articles to synthesize into a perfect article for those who just started AWS like me. The goal will be to help you understand the concept of Cloud Computing and the tips for taking the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certification.
