## ClusterIP

ClusterIP (the default type) exposes the port only inside the cluster. Such a port would not be accessible from anywhere outside. ClusterIP is useful when we want to enable communication between Pods and still prevent any external access.

## Why Use Ingress Objects?

> Ingress objects manage external access to the applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster.

## The Volumes

> We can describe Volumes as a way to access a file system that might be running on the same host or somewhere else. No matter where that file system is, it is external to the containers that mount volumes. There can be many reasons why someone might mount a Volume, with state preservation being only one of them.
