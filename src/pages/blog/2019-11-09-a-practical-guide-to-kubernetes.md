## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes was first developed by a team at Google. It is based on their experience from running containers at scale for years. Later on, it was donated to Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It is a true open source project with probably the highest velocity in history.

## Why Kubernetes?

* We can use it to deploy our services, to roll out new releases without downtime, and to scale (or de-scale) those services.
* It is portable.
* It can run on a public or private cloud.
* It can run on-premise or in a hybrid environment.
* We can move a Kubernetes cluster from one hosting vendor to another without changing (almost) any of the deployment and management processes.
* Kubernetes can be easily extended to serve nearly any needs. We can choose which modules we’ll use, and we can develop additional features ourselves and plug them in.
* Kubernetes will decide where to run something and how to maintain the state we specify.
* Kubernetes can place replicas of a service on the most appropriate server, restart them when needed, replicate them, and scale them.
* Self-healing is a feature included in its design from the start. On the other hand, self-adaptation is coming soon as well.
* Zero-downtime deployments, fault tolerance, high availability, scaling, scheduling, and self-healing add significant value in Kubernetes.
* We can use it to mount volumes for stateful applications.
* It allows us to store confidential information as secrets.
* We can use it to validate the health of our services.
* It can load balance requests and monitor resources.
* It provides service discovery and easy access to logs.
